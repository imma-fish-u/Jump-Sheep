# Jumping-sheep
A game where sheep is jumping on blocks, passing over all obstacles-strikes and collecting coins. Made in Unity3D.
I was following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lQwL94JKpE) on YouTube.
## I've learnt how to use:
- singleton pattern in unity
- some functions from DG.Tweening library for nice animation
- camera follow for player
- active/non-active property to randomize blocks settings
- ui
